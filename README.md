## Welcome to Woethief

I am Woethief and this is my story. If you enjoy comfortable tales full of romance and happy coincedences, then look elsewhere. What I will tell you is not pretty, but it is the truth.

Many people say they would take the pain of a loved one if they had the chance. I am not so sure; I've done it. I have stollen the shame and pain of many. You cannot begin to comprehend my anguish.

*Each successive chapter will be posted over time. Once the story is complete, I will make it availailable for download in multiple formats.*
