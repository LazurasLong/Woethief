## 018 Safehouse?

Den carried me out of the hall.

*Congratulations, Nyl you certainly made a mess of that situation.*

*Who said that?*

*You did.*

*What? I don’t understand.*

*I am Woethief, your other half.*

*Den, help! I don’t know what is happening.* I tightened my grip on his collar as if I would fall. He didn’t receive my thoughts.

*Relax, Nyl. I do not wish to harm you.*

*Who are you?* I asked the unfamiliar voice that separated me from Den.

*When you received the Orderer Stone, your mind split. We are both Nyla Woethief, but because of the Stone’s long absence our mind broke once it was returned.*

*Let me speak to Den?*

*“It is true Nyl; I am sorry. I didn't know it would happen,”* he informed me.

My head drooped onto my breast. Even attempts to aid me failed. I could not blame Den or Thee’ of course; they did what they thought was right.

*What are we to do now?*

*“Now, we wait. My sister will surely rejoin us and then, if you are still willing, she may plant her parasite.”*

*Of course we are willing.* Nyl and Woe said in unison.

Den’s constant backtracking and zagzigging, brought me through parts of the city which I had never visited. Many of the buildings were carved from solid stone rather than formed from crumbling blocks. When Den set me down, we entered a tunnel and spent another ten minutes maneuvering through the labyrinth. My guide never faltered.

He said little as we journeyed. I loathed myself for the pain my actions brought him. Though Thee's venom brought partial healing to his body, I knew my actions disappointed and angered him.

After assuring himself that no one had followed us, he pulled me into the street. I stood in front of a small house with attractive carvings on the lintel.

*“It is modest, but I believe you will be comfortable.”*

He led me by the hand into a two-room apartment. Food and various supplies lined shelves along all the walls and a faucet stood in the corner.

*You have a faucet?*

*“Yes”*

*You have a faucet!*

Tears of joy spilled down my face as I rushed toward the object of my excitement. In utter bafflement, I stared at the device, unsure of how to operate it. Den twisted the knob. Water spilled into the basin. I twisted the knob until it poured at its greatest pressure.

The cool liquid felt so good on my skin as I splashed it onto my face.

*“Are you trying to flood the house?”* Den asked as he rubbed his hand on my hair playfully, forgetting his anger. My braid realigned itself instantly.

I shut off the water and leaned back into him. My head barely reached his stomach.

*Thank you ever so much. I have never known such luxury.*

Sadness filled his heart. He pitied me for the squalor I had lived in previously.

*“I must leave you alone for a while. I advise you to remain inside.”*

*Where are you going?*

*“I am a guard for a prominent storehouse. Once you are restored to heirship,”* he spoke as if it were a certainty. *“I will be able to guard you at all times instead of protecting crates of loaf-plant.”*

*But what of your wounds?*

*"I'll manage; I've had worse."*

*When can I expect Thee’?*

*“When she is ready.”*

*When will that be?*

*“I haven’t the faintest idea. She does as she wills and I do not pretend to understand her actions. Everything she does is purposeful, but I am too dull to understand her strategy.”*

*When you come back, buy something nice for her,* Nyl requested.

*“I will. Eat anything you please. There are fresh linens on your cot. The latrine is behind that door.”*

Once he changed into fresh clothes in the latrine, he departed.

*“One last thing, you will not be able to speak to my mind until my watch is over. It takes too much concentration on my part.”*

*I understand.*

I surveyed the lovely, little house. To me it was a veritable palace. The cot was so soft and there was another faucet in the latrine.

*This is wonderful! Everything is so beautiful in this little place!* Nyl exclaimed.

*The furniture is sparse and well-used. Den clearly has little money.* Woe commented.

*Even poverty is better than the slavery I knew.*

*We will not starve. He has a month’s supply of food on those shelves.*

I rested on my cot under a snug wool blanket. Perhaps life could become good even if I did not become Princess.

Desperate pounding on my door broke me out of my musings. I clutched a pistol and opened the door a crack.
