## 009 Preparations for the Duel

Gentle rapping on my door roused me from my troubled sleep. I admitted Faithful and Silver into my room.

**“I trust you slept well and are prepared for our duel,”** Silver spoke, feigning politeness.

*How could anyone sleep before such a momentous event?*

“I slept an hour. I fear duel. Not read-y,” I snapped.

**“I am sorry to anger you. I was only trying to be friendly.”**

I threw myself on her neck as the bottles of my tears were unstopped. Somehow, she had the same effect on me that Faithful did even though I knew who she really was.

“Duel cause much fear. I not want win, not wish loss. Not wish hurt your fu-ture.”

**“Regardless of who wins, the three of us will still have each another. We won't desert you if I win,”** declared Faithful.

“That not scare me. I not want hurt you like I did them. One man left fight with-out his hand. And, and…”

**“What is it, Nyl?”**

“I with child,” I whispered. “Not want her hurt.”

**“Then I'll cede my victory to you. I will not endanger your child.”**

“They not let you give up. If you do, all hate you. Not fair to wife.”

**“I'm already despised by all, save the two of you. Your safety is more important than my reputation.”**

My mistress prevented me from warning my only friend of his death and spoke to my mind.

*“I hope you will enjoy killing him today.”*

“You not give up. I for-bid it!” I crossed my arms and attempted to increase my stature.

**“You can't forbid it. I'm your master.”**

“If I not for-bid it, I be heir with right to for-bid you…” I stopped before I said something even more ludicrous. “Why risk self for child of vile slave?”

**“Because the child is innocent. Whatever was done to you isn't your fault.”**

“You not blame me?”

**“Should he?”** Silver asked her thrumming was gentle, but the sarcasm in her mind stung.

“I did no wrong! He trick me to wed him. He div-or-ced me one month. I want win. Then I kill him!”

Silver didn’t respond at first. She just held me until I quelled my weeping.

**“Nyla, you won’t really kill him will you?”** She thrummed quietly.

"How I not kill if you make me?" I whispered back.

**“Force you to? Why would I? I love him.”**

"But you told me kill him?"

**"I did not. That was Centin. He ordered me on this hit to poison both of you, but I couldn’t do it. I traded all of my power for this body, so I could start a new life. Should I want to, I would not be able to overtake you."**

When I reached into her mind, I found no vestiges of the power she once possessed.

**"I spent half of last night weeping as I told Faithful everything I’ve done to you. As you slept, I tried to steal back the pain and shame I had given you. I think I regained some and I won't send you any more.”**

Her words were true, the river of guilt which perpetually flowed from her had stopped.

"Why do this?"

**“Faithful told me of his God. I did it because I might just be able to earn redemption for myself. Perhaps if I can replace my hatred for you with devotion to my husband, God might forgive my iniquities.”**

"There no good you can do to clean bad of past." I told her, knowing it was also true for myself. "If you for-giv-en, it be by woe-thief more great than me."

After Faithful left, Silver helped me to dress in trousers with a short gown over the top. In the night, my bandages had disappeared and left rough scars across my skin. I tied back my hair, fastened my dagger which was no longer gauze, to a sheath my right forearm; armor and hand-daggers were illegal for this duel. My left arm, hung useless in a sling. It throbbed with pain.
