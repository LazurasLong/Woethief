## 007 What to Do about the Girl

The sound of a dirge drifted through the cramped passageways and darkness. The girl, who had tried to seduce Faithful, rubbed her many pairs of spider-legs together as she sang her lament from his doorway.

She threw herself before Faithful and clutched at his feet. Her ears drooped in dejection and her spider-legs wrapped tightly round her body as if she were dying.

**"Please, sir, you must accept me. They will kill me if you don't."**

She grovelled in the darkness with her hair and legs and wings all tangled together. Faithful set me down before he stooped and raised her to her claw-feet. She quickly morphed her wings and spider-legs into a tasteful gown.

**"Explain yourself,"** Faithful ordered.

**"Natia decreed that a priestess must serve each finalist on the night before the tournament,"** she thrummed into the ground. **"None desired you, so Natia personized me to serve you. If you accept me, I shall remain with you for life. I will serve your God. Please, I beg you to take me or they will destroy me with fire."**

“If she is new, how she know so much?” I asked.

**“I was granted all necessary knowledge to fulfill my duty,”** she replied.
Fear of her loveliness overcame me. I sat there below them as rigid as the stones at my feet, saying nothing and doing nothing.

Faithful’s thoughts again penetrated my mind. *"You know that I must honor her. If she speaks the truth, it would be like murder to send her away."*

*You aim to accept her?*

*"Yes, it's the only noble thing to do."*

*She is lying. I cannot tell you how I know, but she is surely lying.*

*“Nyla, your fear is hindering your judgment.”*

He bore no remembrance of the fear and the torture of his childhood that I had taken into myself. Grief filled me as the girl before me destroyed any chance that the one man who might love me ever would.

A mob of priestesses and devotees of Natia trampled toward us.

**“You would refuse the gift of Natia?”** the chief priestess demanded with raised weapons.

Faithful stepped in front of his new slave in her defense. **“You offered me this girl as a trifle to win my allegiance to Natia. You intended for me to dishonor her. I will accept her, but not in worship of your Natia. I take her because my God demands that I preserve her life. This woman is now my wife and when I have vanquished in the duel tomorrow, she shall be my princess.”**
